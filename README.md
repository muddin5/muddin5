# Goals
I plan to use Github to track both my coursework, and self learning as my goals continue to only evolve.
So far these are the sites I will be practicing on and uploading projects for.
All sites and credits will be linked in their respective repositories, 
but if any other students would like to use them as a guide for where to begin their own self-learning journey, feel free to reach out or use these as well, as 
the majority of the sites I plan to use will be free so nobody has to face financial constraints
